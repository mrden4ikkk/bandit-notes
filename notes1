# 1. Search for the file named data.txt -- The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work. Use mkdir with a hard to guess directory name. Or better, use the command “mktemp -d”. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!)

find . -name "data.txt"

# 2. Create a temporary working directory
tmpdir=$(mktemp -d)
cd "$tmpdir"

# 3. Copy and rename the hex dump
cp /home/bandit12/data.txt .
mv data.txt hex_dump.txt

# 4. Convert hex → binary
xxd -r hex_dump.txt > compressed.bin
